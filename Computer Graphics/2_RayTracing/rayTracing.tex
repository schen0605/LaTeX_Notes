\begin{itemize}
  \item Rendering takes an input of a set of objects and outputs an array of pixels
  \item In \textbf{object-order rendering}, each object is considered in turn (for each object). In \textbf{image-order rendering}, each pixel is considered in turn (for each pixel).
  \item Image-order rendering is simpler to get working and more flexibile but takes longer to produce a comparable image
\end{itemize}
